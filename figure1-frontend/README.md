# Figure 1 Feed Challenge

## Overview

Build a simplified 'Figure 1' application to fetch data from [this](https://us-central1-figure1-admin-dev.cloudfunctions.net/demoFeed) endpoint and display a feed of cases.

The frontend can be created using either React or React Native. You can use any frameworks, libraries or templates.

You could use React(figure1-web-test) and React Native(Figure1MobileTest) project templates in this folder or start fresh with your own. The templates have a React-Redux setup included, but you could use any other state managing approaches you like.

We suggest to keep the time spent on this test within 1 hours.

## Requirements

1. Create a React or React Native client that fetches the feed from the API and displays the cases.   The list of cases should be scrollable and display the **title**, **username** and **image**.
1. Add a detail page which is opened when a case is clicked in the feed.  The detail page should include the above data as well the **caption**.
1. Add some basic styling to make the application presentable.

## Things to keep in mind

Code quality is more important than features.  Your code will be evaluated based on:
1. Code Structure
1. Best Practices
1. Readability
1. Maintainability

In addition, please consider the following questions as you develop your solution.  These may be discussed more in a later interview.
 - How would you improve the implementation if given more time?
 - Do you think your approach scales well? Where do you think the first failure point would be?
 - Would adding another similar feature take the same amount of time?
